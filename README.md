# 🌊 Flood Detection using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery and Machine Learning

## 🎓 BMS Institute of Technology & Management
Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Mini Project – 5th Semester (2025)

## 📌 Project Overview

Floods cause severe damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and human life. Rapid detection of flooded regions is critical for disaster management and emergency response.

This project presents a Machine Learning-based Flood Detection System using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery.

Unlike forecasting systems that predict future flood events, this system focuses on detecting flooded areas from current satellite observations using SAR-based feature extraction and supervised classification.
